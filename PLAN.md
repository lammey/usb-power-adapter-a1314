# Plan

## Modelling the thread
- The thread has a flat edge unlike the edge on a typical screw. Its thickness also tapers towards its ends. So we can model it as a spiral with constant thickness that has been intersected by a plane both above and below.
- The spiral parameters I've obtained by measuring the original screw cap with digital calipers. We need:
    - Thickness. Fortunately the spiral attains a constant thickness for some length between the tapering ends
    - Height of an entire loop. This cannot be measured directly because there is no point on the screw cap where there are two untapered wraps of the thread. But it can be calculated by adding the thickness (which we have) to the gap between wraps.
    - The distance between the two planar bisections. Digital calipers.
    - Inner and outer radii. Readily measurable.
## Measurements
- outer diameter: 16mm 
- inner diameter: 14mm (derived from 16-1mm x2)
- thread diameter: 15mm
- thickness of top bit: 0.75mm
- thickness of thread at thickest point: 1.35mm
- distance between rim and thread start height: 1.3mm
- top of lower thread to bottom of higher thread: 1.15mm 
- height of 1 loop = 2.5mm (1.15+1.35)
- top cutoff to bottom cutoff (1.9mm)
- spring depth = ?
